1. First we have the Java **source code.**
2. Then, it is **compiled** using the `javac` command. This command translate the source code to a Java **bytecode** (the machine language of the virtual machine).
3. Finally, the Java bytecode is interpreted using the `java` command.
4. This interpreted program can be ran on any device as long as it has Java.
