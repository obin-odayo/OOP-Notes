## Example of Classes and Objects

Say we have a `human` class and it has an age attribute. We can instance many `human` objects with difference ages.

`human(int age)`

        -> `human(10)`

        -> `human(12)`

        -> `human(20)`

Key points:

- Each instantiation is distinct from another object.
- Each instantiation has its own attributes (the `age`).


## Difference of Procedural and OO

In procedural:

- We think of what **functions** need to be implemented.

In OO:

- We think of what **entities** need to be implemented.
