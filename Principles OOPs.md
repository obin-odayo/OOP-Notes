1. **Encapsulation**. A **bundle of data and actions** within a class.
    1. As long as the method within the class returns the _appropriate value_ there is no need to know the inner mechanisms.
2. **Abstraction**. **Hiding** the irrelevant details.
    1. Details that are not required to be shown are _not shown_.
    2. How a method or function works is not required to be _understood_.
3. **Inheritance**. **Passing down information** between the super class and sub class.
    1. A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
4. **Polymorphism**. Allows for objects of a specific class to be **treated as different classes**.
    1. A class can have difference characteristics simultaneously; a square can be a rectangle and a shape, but not all rectangles are squares, and not all shapes are squares.
