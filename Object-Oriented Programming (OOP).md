- Focused on objects and interaction.
- Objects can be composed of variables and perform actions; or it **has attributes** and **can perform methods**.
- Encourages **generalization** and **abstraction**.
- This paradigm grants more control over:
    - storage and access of data;
    - processes;
    - origin of the processes.
- Since OOP provides more control, it requires more effort from the programmer.
- Allows for solving large scale problems through _representation_, _behavior_, and _relationships._
