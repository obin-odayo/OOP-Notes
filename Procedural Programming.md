- Focused is on the process.
- Instruction-driven program.
- Functions are used to generalize code repetition.
- Data can be typically accessed anywhere in the program
    - As parameters, global data, or pointers.
    - If it is not localized (e.g., declared in a function, passed as a parameter, etc.), then a function cannot call the data. In general, what stays in the function, _stays in the function._
