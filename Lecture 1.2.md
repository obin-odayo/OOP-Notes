## Java as Compiled and Interpreted



## Writing Java Application

A Java application consists of one or more Java classes.

- The file extension is `.java`
- The file name must be the class name (case sensitive).

     public class code {

     }

So for the code snippet above, the file name is `code.java` since the class name is `code`.
